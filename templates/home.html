  <h1>ABout the Billionare data</h1>
  <p>The data used in this web app is from the CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found</p>
   <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/billionaires/">here</a>
   <p>The data from this project goes in depth on the numbers and backstory of 2000 billionares. They sorted the list from rank highest to lowest net worth from years 
      1996, 2001, and 2014. One thing that I didn't know and other people woudln't know about the data set is a "gpd"</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>A gpd is an overview of the billionares country's wealth and inflation. A higher gpd means the country has a rising amount of money and inflation. A gpd can also
      be used to estimate a countries economy and growth rate. For example during covid gpd of the U.S dropped and is slowly rising back up again reflecting the economy of today</p>

   <p>One last thing to notice is that the same billionare could pop up multiple times becauses the data is over 3 specific years, in those three years the billionare could haved 
      changed ranking or even stayed the same</p>
